## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `playbooks/install_cnv.yml` — installs OpenShift Virtualization: namespace,
  OperatorGroup, `kubevirt-hyperconverged` Subscription on the `stable` channel,
  and the `HyperConverged` CR, then waits for the operator to report `Available`
  and the RHEL boot-source DataSource to be `Ready`. Idempotent, no prompts,
  every input via `extra_vars`. Discovers the cluster's default StorageClass at
  run time rather than hard-coding one, so it is not tied to a single catalog
  item. Deliberately does not enable hugepages, KSM, or workload partitioning —
  each writes a MachineConfig and reboots the node, and AAP is co-resident on
  the only node in this catalog item. (#1)
- `playbooks/setup.yml` — Phase 0 entry point; currently imports
  `install_cnv.yml`. The AAP bootstrap half of #1 imports here when it lands, so
  the skill, the README table, and the future job template never re-point.
- `.claude/skills/ocpvirt-setup/SKILL.md` — first in-repo skill. Preflight
  checks, a cluster-side check for whether CNV is already present, then invokes
  `playbooks/setup.yml`. No business logic, per the two-entry-point contract.
  Ends in a verification step that queries the cluster for the
  `kubevirt.io`/`cdi`/`hco`/`instancetype` API groups, the `u1` instance-type
  shapes the sizing tiers depend on, and `devices.kubevirt.io/kvm` on the node —
  a green Ansible recap is not treated as proof. (#1)
- `kubernetes.core.k8s` and `kubernetes.core.k8s_info` added to `.ansible-lint`
  `mock_modules` so the offline CI lint gate can resolve them.

- Initial repository skeleton for the two-axis layout: `demos/` by demo,
  `terraform/` by platform, `inventory/group_vars/` by environment.
- `docs/plan/ocpvirt-demo-plan.md` — environment research confirming the RHDP
  "Ansible Product Demo" catalog item supports OpenShift Virtualization, plus
  the phase-by-phase implementation plan.
- `ROADMAP.md` covering phases 0–4 and the t-shirt sizing tiers.
- Secrets convention: `inventory/group_vars/<env>/secrets.yml` as the single
  place every environment-specific value lives, with `secrets.yml.example` as
  the repo's only `.example` file.
- `.gitignore` as the first commit, so no environment-specific value can enter
  history.
- CI lint gate ported and adapted from `aap_config`: yamllint, ansible-lint,
  a secret-hygiene guard, and a portability check on in-repo skills.
- `utilities/check-no-secrets.sh` — enforces the pre-push audit automatically.
  Matches the shape of real credentials so docs and `.example` placeholders pass
  while genuine values fail the build.
- `.yamllint`, `.ansible-lint`, and pinned `collections/requirements.yml`.
- GitHub CODEOWNERS, PR template, issue templates, and security policy.

### Changed
- `inventory/hosts.yml` pins `ansible_python_interpreter` to
  `{{ ansible_playbook_python }}`. Interpreter discovery otherwise picks whatever
  `/usr/bin` python it finds first, which on Fedora can be an older minor version
  without the `kubernetes` client. Pinned in the inventory rather than an
  `ansible.cfg`, which would shadow `~/.ansible.cfg` and break certified
  collection installs. (#1)

### Notes
- `aap_config`'s `deploy-{dev,qa,prod}` workflows were deliberately not ported
  and will not be (#7). CI is a PR gate only; nothing deploys from GitHub
  Actions. Deploys run via `ansible-playbook` — wrapped by a skill locally, or
  as an AAP job template — which keeps every environment-specific value in the
  gitignored `secrets.yml` with no second copy in GitHub Environment secrets.
